The results suggest that hydrogen slightly increases yield strength, while decreases tensile strength. The susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement of specimens aged at 650 °C firstly reduces and then increases as the aging time increases, reaching the lowest value at aging time 4 h. This is dominantly attributed to the highest content of austenite. Moreover, hydrogen-induced crack nucleation sites initiate from lath, packet and prior austenite grain boundaries. Crack propagation passes through lath boundaries and walks along packet, prior austenite grain boundaries. Scanning electron microscopy result indicates that hydrogen-charged specimens show quasi-cleavage fracture and intergranular fracture in annular brittle zone while dimple fracture is observed in hydrogen-free specimens.

Several increasingly effective ALK inhibitors are now available for treatment of patients. However, despite an initial favorable response to treatment, in most cases relapse or progression occurs due to resistance mechanisms mainly caused by mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK. The detection of an ALK rearrangement is pivotal and can be done using different methods, which have variable sensitivity and specificity depending, in particular, on the quality and quantity of the patient’s sample. This review will first highlight briefly some information regarding the pathobiology of an ALK rearrangement and the epidemiology of patients harboring this genomic alteration. The different methods used to detect an ALK rearrangement as well as their advantages and disadvantages will then be examined and algorithms proposed for detection in daily routine practice.","title":"ALK in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Pathobiology, Epidemiology, Detection from Tumor Tissue and Algorithm Diagnosis in a Daily Practice"},"admin":{"seal":true},"created_date":"2018-10-26T07:49:34Z","id":"937c7aa790e048d4ae5f53a2ad71f0dc"}

Earlier, the biosurfactant was isolated and characterized in our laboratory from Candida parapsilosis. The property of the biosurfactant is further explored in this study by using quantum dots (QDs) as nanocarrier.Materials and methods: Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) were synthesized by bottom-up approach through pyrolysis of citric acid. GQDs were conjugated with both biosurfactant and folic acid (FA) using carbodiimide chemistry. The prepared GQD bioconjugate was studied for diagnostic and therapeutic effects against cancer cells.Results and discussion: Photoluminescence quantum yield (QY) of plain GQDs was measured as 12.8%. QY for biosurfactant conjugated GQDs and FA-biosurfactant conjugated GQDs was measured as 10.4% and 9.02%, respectively, and it was sufficient for targeting cancer cells. MTT assay showed that more than 90% of cells remained viable at concentration of 1 mg/mL, hence GQDs seemed to be non-toxic to cells. Biosurfactant conjugated GQDs caused 50% reduction in cellular viability within 24 hours. FA conjugation further increased the specificity of bioconjugated GQDs toward tumor cells, which is clearly evident from the drug internalization studies using confocal laser scanning microscopy. A higher amount of drug uptake was observed when bioconjugated GQDs were decorated with FA.Conclusion: The ability of GQD bioconjugate could be used as a theranostic tool for cancer. It is foreseen that in near future cancer can be detected and/or treated at an early stage by utilizing biosurfactant conjugated GQDs. Therefore, the proposed study would provide a stepping stone to improve the life of cancer patients.

However, few high-precision temperature sensors can complete the observation of temperature profile of sea ice, especially in extreme environments. At present, the most widely used sea ice observation instruments can reach an accuracy of sea ice temperature measurement of 0.1 &#176;C. In this study, a multilayer sea ice temperature sensor is developed with temperature measurement accuracy from &#8722;0.0047 &#176;C to 0.0059 &#176;C. The sensor system composition, structure of the thermistor string, and work mode are analyzed. The performance of the sensor system is evaluated from &#8722;50 &#176;C to 30 &#176;C. The temperature dependence of the constant current source, the amplification circuit, and the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) circuit are comprehensive tested and quantified. A temperature correction algorithm is designed to correct any deviation in the sensor system. A sea-ice thickness discrimination algorithm is proposed in charge of determining the thickness of sea ice automatically. The sensor system was field tested in Wuliangsuhai, Yellow River on 31 January 2018 and the second reservoir of Fen River, Yellow River on 30 January 2018. The integral practicality of this sensor system is identified and examined. The multilayer sea ice temperature sensor will provide good temperature results of sea ice and maintain stable performance in the low ambient temperature.","title":"Design and Performance Analysis of a Multilayer Sea Ice Temperature Sensor Used in Polar Region"},"admin":{"seal":true},"created_date":"2018-12-18T08:13:29Z","id":"152f83d12b9f477696e681684ba696e7"}

In this context, strategies that guide vehicles from one point to another, looking for the most optimal path, are needed. Most contributions in the literature are routing strategies that take into account different criteria to select the optimal route required to find a parking space. This paper aims to identify the types of smart parking systems (SPS) that are available today, as well as investigate the kinds of vehicle detection techniques (VDT) they have and the algorithms or other methods they employ, in order to analyze where the development of these systems is at today. To do this, a survey of 274 publications from January 2012 to December 2019 was conducted. The survey considered four principal features: SPS types reported in the literature, the kinds of VDT used in these SPS, the algorithms or methods they implement, and the stage of development at which they are. Based on a search and extraction of results methodology, this work was able to effectively obtain the current state of the research area. In addition, the exhaustive study of the studies analyzed allowed for a discussion to be established concerning the main difficulties, as well as the gaps and open problems detected for the SPS. The results shown in this study may provide a base for future research on the subject.","title":"Survey of Smart Parking Systems"},"admin":{"seal":true},"id":"9cf511bab39445ba9745feb43d7493dd","created_date":"2020-06-03T00:02:28Z"}
