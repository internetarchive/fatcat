    ## Introduction

    Fatcat is a scalable, versioned, API-oriented catalog of bibliographic
    entities and file metadata.

    These API reference documents, along with client software libraries, are
    generated automatically from an OpenAPI 2.0 ("Swagger") definition file.

    A higher-level introduction to the API, as well as a description of the
    fatcat data model, are available in ["The Fatcat Guide"](https://guide.fatcat.wiki/).
    The guide also includes a [Cookbook](https://guide.fatcat.wiki/cookbook.html)
    section demonstrating end-to-end tasks like creating entities as part of
    editgroups, or safely merging duplicate entities.

    ### Expectations and Best Practices

    A test/staging QA API instance of fatcat is available at
    <https://api.qa.fatcat.wiki/v0>. The database backing this instance is
    separate from the production interface, and is periodically rebuilt from
    snapshots of the full production database, meaning that edits on the QA
    server will *NOT* persist, and that semantics like the changelog index
    monotonically increasing *MAY* be broken. Developers are expexcted to test
    their scripts and tools against the QA instance before running against
    production.

    Fatcat is made available as a gratis (no cost) and libre (freedom
    preserving) service to the public, with limited funding and resources. We
    welcome new and unforseen uses and contributions, but may need to impose
    restrictions (like rate-limits) to keep the service functional for other
    users, and in extreme cases reserve the option to block accounts and IP
    ranges if necessary to keep the service operational.

    The Internet Archive owns and operates it's own server equipment and data
    centers, and operations are optimized for low-cost, not high-availability.
    Users and partners should expect some downtime on the fatcat API, on the
    order of hours a month.

    Periodic metadata exports are available for batch processing, and database
    snapshots can be used to create locally-hosted mirrors of the service for
    more intensive and reliable querying.

    ### Other Nitty Gritties

    Cross-origin requests are allowed for the API service, to enable third
    parties to bulid in-browser applications.

    A metadata search service is available at <https://search.fatcat.wiki> (and
    <https://search.qa.fatcat.wiki>). The API is currently the raw
    elasticsearch API, with only GET (read) requests allowed. This public
    service is experimental and may be removed or limited in the future.

    ## Authentication

    The API allows basic read-only "GET" HTTP requests with no authentication.
    Proposing changes to the metadata, or other mutating requests ("PUT",
    "POST", "DELETE") all require authentication, and some operations require
    additional account permissions.

    End-user account creation and login happens through the web interface. From
    a logged-in editor profile page, you can generate a API token. Tokens are
    "macaroons", similar to JWT tokens, and are used for all API
    authentication. The web interface includes macaroons in browser cookies and
    passes them through to the API to authenticate editor actions.

    description: |
      The only current API authentication mechanism is HTTP bearer
      authentication using the `Authorization` HTTP header. The header should
      be formatted as the string "Bearer", then a space, then API token (in the
      usual base64 string encoding).

      An example HTTP request would look on the wire like:

          GET /v0/auth/check HTTP/1.1
          Accept: */*
          Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
          Authorization: Bearer AgEPZGV2LmZhdGNhdC53aWtpAhYyMDE5MDEwMS1kZXYtZHVtbXkta2V5AAImZWRpdG9yX2lkID0gYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYmt2a2FhYWFhYWFhYWkAAht0aW1lID4gMjAxOS0wMS0wOVQwMDo1Nzo1MloAAAYgnroNha1hSftChtxHGTnLEmM/pY8MeQS/jBSV0UNvXug=
          Connection: keep-alive
          Host: api.qa.fatcat.wiki
          User-Agent: HTTPie/0.9.8

      Headers can be passed on the command line using `http` (HTTPie) like:

          http get https://api.qa.fatcat.wiki/v0/auth/check Authorization:"Bearer AgEPZGV2LmZhdGNhdC53aWtpAhYyMDE5MDEwMS1kZXYtZHVtbXkta2V5AAImZWRpdG9yX2lkID0gYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYmt2a2FhYWFhYWFhYWkAAht0aW1lID4gMjAxOS0wMS0wOVQwMDo1Nzo1MloAAAYgnroNha1hSftChtxHGTnLEmM/pY8MeQS/jBSV0UNvXug="

      Or with `curl`:

          curl -H "Authorization: Bearer AgEPZGV2LmZhdGNhdC53aWtpAhYyMDE5MDEwMS1kZXYtZHVtbXkta2V5AAImZWRpdG9yX2lkID0gYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYmt2a2FhYWFhYWFhYWkAAht0aW1lID4gMjAxOS0wMS0wOVQwMDo1Nzo1MloAAAYgnroNha1hSftChtxHGTnLEmM/pY8MeQS/jBSV0UNvXug=" https://qa.fatcat.wiki/v0/auth/check

        editgroup, several entities, then accepting the editgroup, both in

        Create a set of Release entities as part of a new editgroup, and

        This method is mostly useful for bulk import of new entities by

        editgroup, several entities, then accepting the editgroup, both in
        terms of API requests required and database load. Requires `admin`
        role.

        List is sorted by changelog index in descending order. Note that the
        accepted timestamp roughly corresponds to order, but not strictly;
        there exist out-of-order timestamps on the order of several seconds.

        As a known database issue, it is technically possible for there to be a
        gap in changelog index numbers (aka, a missing changelog entry). There
        are no currently known gaps and this is considered a bug that will be
        addressed.

        There are millions of entries; to paginate through all of them, use
        this method to discover the highest existing entry number, then request
        the entries using `get_changelog_entry` one at a time.

        and/or OAuth. Most accounts (including tool and bot accounts) do not
