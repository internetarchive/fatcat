Bulk author disambiguation helper (find other unresolved authors with same
alias text and select; drag works between columns)

Bulk query-then-edit UI: search results in a table, edit like a spreadsheet, up
to... dozens? Query and then apply delta (eg, set topic)? Eg, author edits
basic metadata for all their citations all at once.
