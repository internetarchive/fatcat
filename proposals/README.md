This folder contains proposals for larger changes to the fatcat system. These
might be schema changes, new projects, technical details, etc. Any change which
is large enough to require planning and documentation.

Each should be tagged with a date first drafted, and labeled with a status:

- brainstorm: just putting ideas down; might not even happen
- planned: commited to happening, but not started yet
- work-in-progress: currently being worked on
- implemented: completed, merged to master/production/live
